# CMEE Coursework Repository

## Description:

This is the repository of the coursework for MSc in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution, Imperial College London Silwood Campus, for the academic year 2022/23.

The CourseWork in this repository is mainly composed of the contents in *The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist* from the link: https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html

The major source of the dataset are from:
git@github.com:mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio.git

## Structure:

The contents in each directory are listed as follows.

### Week1:

Week1 is an introduction to the Unix & Linux system.

- Shell scripting

- LaTeX learning

### Week2:

This directory contains mainly the instructions to Python programming, which includes:

- Loops and list comprehensions

- Writing a program with control flows

- Unit testing with docstring

- Some commonly used Python packages

### Week3:

Week3 mainly focus on the R scripting.

- R basics

- R control flows

- Vectorization

- Debugging

### Week7:

Week7 contains some advanced skills in Python, and also an introduction to Jupyter Notebook.
